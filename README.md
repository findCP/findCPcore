## findCPcore - find ChokePoint reactions in genome-scale metabolic models

```findCPcore``` is a Python tool for the computation of chokepoint reactions in genome-scale metabolic models. The tool allows the calculation of chokepoints taking into account only the topology of the metabolic network or also using its dynamic information.

The documentation can be found at [readthedocs](https://findcpcore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and can also be [downloaded](https://findcpcore.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/).

A command line application of the tool is provided at [findCPcli](https://github.com/findCP/findCPcli).

You can also [try it with Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/findCP/findCPcore/HEAD?filepath=docs%2Fsource%2FCORE.ipynb).

## Install

```sh
$ pip install findCPcore
```

## Quickstart

Example of network refinement and chokepoint computation:

```python
from findCPcore import CobraMetabolicModel

model = CobraMetabolicModel("aureus.xml")

# update flux bounds with FVA
model.fva(update_flux=True)

# compute chokepoints
model.find_chokepoints()

# get chokepoints
model.chokepoints()
```
